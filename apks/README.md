# 1 . APKs
 We have built 3 APKs:
 a) `webview_android_10` contains APKs from the `106-webview-for-android-10` which work only on Android 10 and beyond.
 
 b) `xwalk_from_branch` is from the same branch (`106-webview-for-android-10`), but uses crosswalk and should work on Android 9 and below.
 
 c) `xwalk_master` is from the `master` branch, uses crosswalk and should work on all versions of Android that we support.
 
# 2. How to install  
To install on the phone, download the desired APK on the phone, click on the file dowloaded and follow the prompt.
One might need to enable developer options and/or allow sideloading (Enable Unknown Sources), if that hasn't been done yet.

# 3. Testing 
We are currentlt testing the [Update target SDK version to 29 #106](https://github.com/medic/medic-android/issues/106#issuecomment-727632035) issue. Please refer to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11E5ueMiMZStUaDsbu_hHEtbnWTP5l92T26tgiHv7aeo/edit#gid=0) for more details.
