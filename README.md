# Release Testing With Github

## Creating Test Cases

As functionality is added to the app we should be adding release tests to ensure we haven't regressed.

* Add a new Issue to the [medic-release-testing](https://github.com/medic/medic-release-testing/issues) repo in github.
* Add a title that describes what is being tested, on which config, with which type of user.
* For the description add which type of user, the type of config, which platform(desktop, mobile app), the steps to test and the expected result.
* Close the issue.
* Add the label `Release Test`

## Generating a Project Board for Testing a Release

Create a [github personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and name it token.json in this directory, like `{"token":"gxgjjuwj-xxxx-xxxx"}`.

The only required permission is `public_repo Access public repositories`

Run `npm install`

Run `node create_release_project.js --version <release_vers>` to create a new project version.

EX: `node create_release_project.js --version 3.3.0`

This will generate a project in medic-release-testing repo. Once completed you should see the link to the project in the console.

EX: Project created at: https://github.com/medic/medic-release-testing/projects/27

To generate a project with specific test cases (eg for minor releases and patches), add a new label to the issues you need to test and modify labels in [config.js](https://github.com/medic/medic-release-testing/blob/master/config.js#L36) to use the new label.

## Executing Test Cases

* Once the project is created all test cases should be in the TODO column.
* Drag the test case you are working on to the In Progress column
* Drag the test case to done when completed.
